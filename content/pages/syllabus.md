Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Prior exposure to probability ([_6.041 Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability_](/courses/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010) or [_18.05 Introduction to Probability and Statistics_](/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014)) and optimization, or permission of the instructor.

Objectives
----------

*   Describe some important issues in the design and operation of manufacturing systems.
*   Explain important measures of system performance.
*   Show the importance of random, potentially disruptive events.
*   Give some intuition about behavior of these systems.
*   Explain the importance of capacity, and how it can vary randomly over time.
*   Teach enough mathematics (especially probability) to describe manufacturing systems behavior.
*   Show how in-process inventory is sometimes a necessary evil â€” that is, show the benefits as well as costs.
*   Present some practical tools for systems design.
*   Describe issues in real-time scheduling, and show why deterministic scheduling is often not adequate.
*   Present some simple scheduling rules.
*   Describe recent related research.

Textbook
--------

Gershwin, Stanley B. _Manufacturing Systems Engineering_. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1993. ISBN: 9780135606087.

The Prentice Hall edition of this book is no longer in print. New copies can be obtained from the author. Please see the [Manufacturing Systems Engineering website](http://web.mit.edu/manuf-sys/www/gershwin.book.html) for details.

Grading
-------

Students are required to complete a term project. Details are given on the {{% resource_link bf95b03a-954f-3d2f-5190-4ff012fd2d5e "Projects" %}} page. No other assignments are given or graded, although optional homework problems are suggested under {{% resource_link 2a6305eb-216d-659a-b854-25db408ebeab "Assignments" %}}. Class participation is also a component of your grade.

Homework is not required. However, it is advisable to do since it helps you to learn and to assess objectively what you know. The list below comes from previous years, when homework was required. Feel free to do problems not listed. All problems are taken from the course text, _Manufacturing Systems Engineering_.

To do some of the problems in chapters 3, 4, and 5 you will need software to evaluate lines. You can write it yourself – it is not very difficult.
